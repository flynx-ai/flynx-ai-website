Expanding the ESLint Configuration

This project includes basic ESLint rules for development. If you’re building a production application, it’s recommended to enable type-aware lint rules. Here’s how:
	1.	Update the parserOptions property in your ESLint configuration:

export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
});


	2.	Replace tseslint.configs.recommended with:
	•	tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked or
	•	tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked.
	3.	Optionally, include stylistic rules:

...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked


	4.	Install eslint-plugin-react and update your configuration:

import react from 'eslint-plugin-react';

export default tseslint.config({
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: { react },
  rules: {
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
});
